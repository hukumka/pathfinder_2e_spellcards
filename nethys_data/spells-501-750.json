You gain a temporary spell slot, which you can fill only by stealing a spell from an enemy spellcaster. During _umbral extraction's_ duration, you can use the [Steal](/Actions.aspx?ID=68) action to attempt to take one of the foe's prepared spells or unused spontaneous spell slots instead of an item. You can also make one attempt to Steal as part of Casting _umbral extraction_. If you succeed at your check to Steal a spell, you deal 1d4 mental damage to the target per level of the spell stolen due to the psychological toll of the spiritual emptiness created by wrenching the spell away, and you place the stolen spell in your temporary spell slot. It gains the [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143) trait if cast from this temporary slot.\n\n Determine the stolen spell at random from the target's spells that are 1 level lower than _umbral extraction_, or from spells of the same level if you got a critical success. If the target has no spell slots of that level, use the highest level below that in which the target does have a spell slot. (If the target has no eligible spells, you get nothing, but you can continue to attempt to Steal spells for the remaining duration.) If the target is a prepared caster, you randomly steal one of their prepared spells. If the target is a spontaneous caster, you instead steal an unexpended spell slot of the appropriate level and determine the spell at random from all the target's known spells at that level. You can't steal a target's innate spells, focus spells, or cantrips. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it, and your temporary spell slot becomes a spell slot of the same level as the spell you stole.\n\n As normal, you can Steal only from a target within your reach. Once you've placed a spell in your temporary spell slot, you can't attempt to Steal more spells. If you succeed at your [Thievery](/Skills.aspx?ID=17) check, you must take the spell you stole. Even if you're a spontaneous caster, you can use the temporary spell slot only to cast the stolen spell and you can cast only the stolen spell from your temporary spell slot. When _umbral extraction_ ends, you lose the temporary spell slot and any spell still stored in it. When you cast _umbral extraction_, any previous casting of _umbral extraction_ currently affecting you ends.","name":"Umbral Extraction","pfs":"Standard","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2021-09-01","resistance":{},"school":"illusion","search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Illusion\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=92\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mental\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=106\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Shadow\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=143\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Secrets of Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=96) pg. 137 <sup>1.1</sup></row>\r\n\r\n**Traditions**\r\n[Arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3)\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n**Cast** [somatic](/Rules.aspx?ID=283), [verbal](/Rules.aspx?ID=284)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Duration** 3 rounds\r\n</row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nAttempt to steal a spell slot.\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Secrets of Magic"],"source_raw":["Secrets of Magic pg. 137"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source_markdown":"<row gap=\"tiny\">[Secrets of Magic](/Sources.aspx?ID=96) pg. 137 <sup>1.1</sup></row>","speed":{},"spell_type":"Spell","summary":"Attempt to steal a spell slot.","summary_markdown":"Attempt to steal a spell slot.","tradition":["Arcane","Occult"],"tradition_markdown":"[Arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3)","trait":["Illusion","Mental","Shadow"],"trait_group":["School","Monster","Planar"],"trait_markdown":"[Illusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=92), [Mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [Shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)","trait_raw":["Illusion","Mental","Shadow"],"type":"Spell","url":"/Spells.aspx?ID=1022","weakness":{}},"sort":[2,"Umbral Extraction",25361]},{"_index":"aon29","_id":"spell-1211","_score":null,"_source":{"actions":"Two Actions","actions_number":4,"bloodline_markdown":"","category":"spell","component":["somatic","verbal"],"domain_markdown":"","duration":18,"duration_raw":"3 rounds","exclude_from_search":false,"heighten_group":["2nd rank"],"heighten_level":[2],"id":"spell-1211","level":2,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Spell 2\" pfs=\"\">\r\n[Umbral Mindtheft](/Spells.aspx?ID=1211)\r\n<actions string=\"Two Actions\" />\r\n</title>\r\n\r\n<spoilers>May contain spoilers from Blood Lords</spoilers>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Illusion\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=92\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Mental\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=106\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Shadow\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=143\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Pathfinder #181: Zombie Feast](/Sources.aspx?ID=139) pg. 80</row>\n\n**Traditions**\r\n[Arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3)\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n**Cast** [somatic](/Rules.aspx?ID=283), [verbal](/Rules.aspx?ID=284)\r\n\r\n \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Duration** 3 rounds\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou prepare to steal a broad field of knowledge from another creature, siphoning it from their mind and storing it in a pocket of the [Shadow Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=11) connected to your own mind.

When you Cast this Spell and each time you Sustain it, you can roll the orb, moving it up to 10 feet along the ground or the surface of a liquid. The orb can move through the spaces of any creatures or obstacles that wouldn't stop the flow of water. It extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its size or smaller, and it attempts to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) any magical fires it moves through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can't counteract that fire for the duration of the spell.\n\n The orb can engulf Large or smaller creatures it moves through, and it can contain as many creatures as fit in its space. The orb can try to engulf the same creature only once per turn, even if you roll it onto a creature's space more than once. Any Large or smaller creature whose space the orb tries to move through can attempt a Reflex save.\r\n\r\n**Success** The creature can either let the orb pass (remaining in its space or moving out of the orb's path into a space of the creature's choice) or allow itself to be [pushed](/Rules.aspx?ID=451) in front of the orb to the end of the orb's movement.<br />\r\n**Failure** The creature is engulfed in the orb. It moves along with the orb and must hold its breath or begin [suffocating](/Rules.aspx?ID=468) (unless it can breathe in water).

While Casting this Spell, you also Cast a Spell of a lower spell level to store in the glyph. The stored spell must take 3 actions or fewer to cast, have a hostile effect, and target one creature or have an area. You can set a password, a trigger, or both for the glyph. Any creature that moves, opens, or touches the target container or enters the target area that doesn't speak the password or that matches the trigger activates the glyph, releasing the harmful spell within.\n\n Once a spell is stored in the glyph, the glyph gains all the traits of that spell. If the stored spell targets one or more creatures, it targets the creature that set off the glyph.

The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you and repeats a basic single action the target took since the end of your last turn, such as making a Strike or Interacting to pull a lever. Because the other basic single actions don't produce much of a result on their own, this is typically used for Strike and Interact, though occasionally it could be useful to have a _temporal twin_ Stride through a potentially dangerous area to expose a hazard. The target ally spends a reaction to create the duplicate, makes any decisions, and rolls for the repeated action, such as choosing a target for a Strike and making the attack roll. If the ally doesn't have a reaction to spend, _temporal twin_ fails. Use the duplicate's location for determining flanking, cover, and the like. Using this spell requires remembering what your ally did, and if you don't remember the details, the GM might not allow you to cast _temporal twin_.\n\n This action can't be used for anything but a [basic single action](/Rules.aspx?ID=439), nor can it use limited resources. The action can have a different target than the original action but must be very similar in form. For example, if the original action were to Interact to pull a lever, the time duplicate could pull a different lever, but couldn't turn a doorknob or pick up an item from a table.\n\n Being pulled through time to create a twin destabilizes the target's timeline. Once an ally has been the target of _temporal twin_, they're temporarily immune for 1 day.","name":"Temporal Twin","pfs":"Standard","range":30,"range_raw":"30 feet","rarity":"uncommon","rarity_id":2,"release_date":"2022-07-27","resistance":{},"school":"conjuration","search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Conjuration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=33\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Dark Archive](/Sources.aspx?ID=129) pg. 183</row>\r\n\r\n**Traditions**\r\n[Arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3)\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n**Cast** [somatic](/Rules.aspx?ID=283), [verbal](/Rules.aspx?ID=284)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Range** 30 feet\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Target** one willing ally\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Duration** until the end of your next turn\r\n</row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nCall a version of yourself from a recent timeline to repeat your actions\r\n\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Dark Archive"],"source_raw":["Dark Archive pg. 183"],"source_category":"Rulebooks","source_markdown":"<row gap=\"tiny\">[Dark Archive](/Sources.aspx?ID=129) pg. 183</row>","speed":{},"spell_type":"Spell","summary":"Call a version of yourself from a recent timeline to repeat your actions\r\n","summary_markdown":"Call a version of yourself from a recent timeline to repeat your actions\r\n","target":"one willing ally","target_markdown":"one willing ally","tradition":["Arcane","Occult"],"tradition_markdown":"[Arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3)","trait":["Conjuration","Uncommon"],"trait_group":["School","Rarity"],"trait_markdown":"[Conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [Uncommon](/Traits.aspx?ID=159)","trait_raw":["Conjuration","Uncommon"],"type":"Spell","url":"/Spells.aspx?ID=1191","weakness":{}},"sort":[3,"Temporal Twin",25523]},{"_index":"aon29","_id":"spell-723","_score":null,"_source":{"actions":"1 minute","actions_number":60,"bloodline_markdown":"","category":"spell","component":["material","somatic","verbal"],"deity":["Followers of Fate","Lymnieris","Magdh","Ra"],"deity_markdown":"[Followers of Fate](/Deities.aspx?ID=210), [Lymnieris](/Deities.aspx?ID=124), [Magdh](/Deities.aspx?ID=97), [Ra](/Deities.aspx?ID=57)","domain_markdown":"","duration_raw":"until the next time you make your daily preparations","exclude_from_search":false,"heighten_group":["3rd rank"],"heighten_level":[3],"id":"spell-723","level":3,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Spell 3\" pfs=\"Standard\">\r\n[Threefold Aspect](/Spells.aspx?ID=723)\r\n<actions string=\"\" />\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Polymorph\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=127\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Transmutation\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=157\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Advanced Player's Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=39) pg. 226 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n**Traditions**\r\n[Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3), [Primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4)\n\n**Deities**\r\n[Followers of Fate](/Deities.aspx?ID=210), [Lymnieris](/Deities.aspx?ID=124), [Magdh](/Deities.aspx?ID=97), [Ra](/Deities.aspx?ID=57)\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n**Cast** 1 minute ([material](/Rules.aspx?ID=282), [somatic](/Rules.aspx?ID=283), [verbal](/Rules.aspx?ID=284))\r\n\r\n \n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Duration** until the next time you make your daily preparations\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis spell allows you to change between three versions of yourself of different ages: a maiden (young adult), a mother (adult), or a matriarch (elderly).

The GM decides if a foe who is disguised grants you this bonus.\n\n---\r\n**Heightened (5th)** The bonus to initiative increases to +2 and the duration increases to 8 hours.\r\n\r\n**Heightened (8th)** The bonus to initiative increases to +3 and the duration increases until the next time you do your daily preparations, and the status bonus to Initiative checks applies to any allies who took part in the fight you transcribed as long as they are within 30 feet of you when you cast the spell.","name":"Transcribe Conflict","pfs":"Limited","range":0,"range_raw":"touch","rarity":"rare","rarity_id":3,"release_date":"2022-10-26","resistance":{},"school":"divination","search_markdown":"<spoilers>May contain spoilers from Kingmaker</spoilers>\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Rare\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=137\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Divination\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=47\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [Kingmaker Companion Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=151) pg. 46</row>\r\n\r\n**Traditions**\r\n[Arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3)\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n**Cast** 1 minute ([material](/Rules.aspx?ID=282), [somatic](/Rules.aspx?ID=283), [verbal](/Rules.aspx?ID=284))\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n**Range** touch\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Duration** 1 hour\r\n</row>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nYou cause a sheet of paper to appear in your hand, and a moment later a detailed description of a combat you experienced within the last hour is recorded on that sheet of paper in a language that you know of your choice.\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Kingmaker Companion Guide"],"source_raw":["Kingmaker Companion Guide pg. 46"],"source_category":"Adventure Paths","source_group":"Kingmaker","source_markdown":"<row gap=\"tiny\">[Kingmaker Companion Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=151) pg. 46</row>","speed":{},"spell_type":"Spell","spoilers":"Kingmaker","summary":"You cause a sheet of paper to appear in your hand, and a moment later a detailed description of a combat you experienced within the last hour is recorded on that sheet of paper in a language that you know of your choice.","summary_markdown":"You cause a sheet of paper to appear in your hand, and a moment later a detailed description of a combat you experienced within the last hour is recorded on that sheet of paper in a language that you know of your choice.","tradition":["Arcane","Occult"],"tradition_markdown":"[Arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3)","trait":["Divination","Rare"],"trait_group":["School","Rarity"],"trait_markdown":"[Divination](/Traits.aspx?ID=47), [Rare](/Traits.aspx?ID=137)","trait_raw":["Divination","Rare"],"type":"Spell","url":"/Spells.aspx?ID=1231","weakness":{}},"sort":[3,"Transcribe Conflict",25555]},{"_index":"aon29","_id":"spell-543","_score":null,"_source":{"actions":"Single Action","actions_number":2,"bloodline_markdown":"","category":"spell","component":["verbal"],"domain_markdown":"","duration":12,"duration_raw":"2 rounds","exclude_from_search":false,"heighten_group":["3rd rank"],"heighten_level":[3],"id":"spell-543","level":3,"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Focus 3\" pfs=\"Standard\">\r\n[Unblinking Flame Revelation](/Spells.aspx?ID=543)\r\n<actions string=\"Single Action\" />\r\n</title>\n\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Abjuration\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=2\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Focus\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=511\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\n\n<row gap=\"tiny\">**Source** [World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=6) pg. 83 <sup>2.0</sup></row>\n\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n**Cast** [verbal](/Rules.aspx?ID=284)\r\n\r\n \n\n**Requirements** Your previous action was a successful unarmed Strike.\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Target** the creature you hit\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\n\n**Duration** 2 rounds\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou light your foe with revealing flame.

You create a 5-foot-thick wall of brambles and thorns in a straight line up to 60 feet long and 10 feet high. You must create the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. The wall stands vertically. If you wish, the wall can be of a shorter length or height. Everything on each side of the wall has [cover](/Rules.aspx?ID=459) from creatures on the opposite side, and the wall's spaces are [difficult terrain](/Rules.aspx?ID=453). For every move action a creature uses to enter at least one of the wall's spaces, that creature takes 3d4 piercing damage. \n\nEach 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 20 Hit Points.
