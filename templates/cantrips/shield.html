    <div>
    You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the
    Raise a Shield action (page 419), giving you a +1 circumstance
    bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn’t
    require a hand to use.
    While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block
    reaction (page 262) with your magic shield. The shield has
    Hardness 5. You can use the spell’s reaction to reduce damage
    from any spell or magical effect, even if it doesn’t deal physical
    damage. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can’t
    cast it again for 10 minutes.
    </div>
