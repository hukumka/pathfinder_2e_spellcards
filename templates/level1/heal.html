    <div>
		You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the
		undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore
		1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount
		of vitality damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save.
		The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell
		determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.
