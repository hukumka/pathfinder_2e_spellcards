    To the target, your words are honey and your visage seems
bathed in a dreamy haze. It must attempt a Will save, with a +4
circumstance bonus if you or your allies recently threatened it
or used hostile actions against it.
You can Dismiss the spell. If you use hostile actions against
the target, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target
doesn’t necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship
with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with
its expectations, meaning you could potentially convince the
target to continue being your friend via mundane means.

to charm it.",

something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies
the spell ",

was friendly, it becomes helpful. It can’t use hostile actions
against you.",
