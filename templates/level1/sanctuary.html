    <div>
    You ward a creature with protective energy that deters attacks.
    Creatures attempting to attack the target must attempt a Will
    save each time. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends.

against the target this turn.",

to attack the target for the rest of sanctuary’s duration."
