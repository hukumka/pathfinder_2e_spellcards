    <div>
    You shout a command that’s hard to ignore. You can command
    the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the fleeing
    condition), release what it’s holding, drop prone, or stand in
    place. It can’t Delay or take any reactions until it has obeyed
    your command. The effects depend on the target’s Will save.
    {{ success_table(
      success="The target is unaffected.",
