    <div>
    You conjure a temporary object from magical energy. It must
consist of earthen or plant-derived matter (such as wood,
paper, brick, or stone) and be 5 cubic feet or smaller. It can’t
rely on intricate artistry or complex moving parts, never fulfills
a cost or the like, and can’t be made of precious materials or
materials with a rarity of uncommon or higher. It is obviously
temporarily conjured, and thus can’t be sold or passed off as a
genuine item. The spell gains the appropriate trait for the item
created, typically earth, plant, or wood.

trait if used to create a metal object.")}}
