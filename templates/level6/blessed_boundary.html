    <div>
    Manifestations of divine force appear in the hundreds, swirling
    in a massive, protective sphere. These typically look like spiky
    fragments, but often take on an appearance themed to the deity
    of the caster. The sphere is hollow, with the manifestations
    forming a shell 2 inches deep on the outer edge. You can choose
    to make the burst smaller, in 5-foot increments, when you cast it.
    The shell provides cover and can intersect solid terrain
    without affecting it. The shell deals 7d8 force damage to each
    creature who intersects with the shell when the sphere’s
    created, or who attempts to move through the shell. The
    creature also takes the damage at the end of its turn, but only
    if it didn’t already take damage from the shell that turn. The
    effects are determined by a creature’s Reflex save.
