    <div>
    You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of
this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action.
The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future
and reveal the GM’s best guess among the following outcomes:
good, bad, mixed (the results will be a mix of good and bad), and
nothing (there won’t be particularly good or bad results).
    </div>
    <div>
    The GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the result
is always “nothing.” This makes it impossible to tell whether a
“nothing” result is accurate. If anyone asks about the same topic
as the first casting of augury during an additional casting, the GM
uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances
change, though, it’s possible to get a different result.
    </div>
