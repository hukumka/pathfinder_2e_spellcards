  <div>
  You offer food, and an ordinary Tiny animal within range
  approaches to eat it. You imprint the image, direction, and
  distance of an obvious place or landmark well known to you
  within the animal. You can also attach a small object or note up to
  light Bulk to it. The animal does its best to reach the destination; if
  it makes it there, it waits nearby and allows nonhostile creatures
  to approach and remove the attached object. The spell ends after
  the message is delivered or after 24 hours, whichever comes first.
  If there are no Tiny wild animals in range, the spell is lost.
  </div>
