{% block description %}
    <div>
    You fire a ray of heat and flame. Make a spell attack roll against
    a single creature. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage,
    and on a critical hit, the target takes double damage.
    </div>
    <div>
    For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell,
    you can fire an additional ray at a different target, to a maximum
    of three rays targeting three different targets for 3 actions.
    These attacks each increase your multiple attack penalty, but
    you donâ€™t increase your multiple attack penalty until after you
    make all the spell attack rolls for blazing bolt. If you spend 2 or
    more actions Casting the Spell, the damage increases to 4d6 fire
    damage on a hit, and it still deals double damage on a critical hit.
    </div>
