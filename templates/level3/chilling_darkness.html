    <div>
    You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy
energy. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals 5d6 cold damage.
If the target has the holy trait, you deal an extra 5d6 spirit damage.
    {{ success_table(
      crit_success="The target takes double damage.",
      success="The target takes full damage.",
      )
    }}
    f the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a
creature affected by magical light, chilling darkness attempts to
counteract the light. If you need to determine whether the ray
passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself
and the spellâ€™s target,
