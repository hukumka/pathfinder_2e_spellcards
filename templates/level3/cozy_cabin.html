    <div>
    You shape a cabin 20 feet on each side and 10 feet high. This
cabin has the structure trait and the same restrictions as
magic items that create structures. The walls of the hut are
simple and wooden, with small, square glass windows, and it
has one wooden door. It doesnâ€™t include its own lock, but it has
a fastener to which a lock can be applied.
The interior contains three cots, one chamber pot, and a small
fireplace holding a magical fire. The interior is lit with a small
magical light that you can light or extinguish at will using a
Sustain action. The climate inside the hut is comfortable and
allows creatures inside it to withstand most hostile weather
conditions, but incredible heat or cold, powerful storms, and
winds of hurricane force or greater destroy the hut. Other
creatures can freely enter and exit the hut without damaging it,
but if you exit the hut, the spell ends. You can Dismiss the spell
